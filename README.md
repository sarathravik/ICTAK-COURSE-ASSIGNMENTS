Modeling is accomplished using both supervised and unsupervised methods.

1.Supervised modelsÂ 

Linear regression, decision trees, random forests, SVR, KNN, and classification models are examples of regression and classification models ( Logistic Regression, SVC,Random Forest, Decision Tree,KNN)

2.Un supervised models

Hirarchial clustering, K-Mean clustering, KNN
